      I am a fresh undergraduate from Tunku Abdul Rahman University of
      Management & Technology who is currently pursuing an internship at Finexus
      International Sdn Bhd. I have learned the fundamentals of Software
      Engineering throughout my tertiary studies. Topics covered during this
      time include Project Management, Quality Assurance, Development
      Principles, Methodologies, etc.
      <br />
      <br />
      I have dedicated my spare time to self-learning other disciplines within
      the Computing & IT field such as Web Development, Cybersecurity, DevOps
      and Data Science. Personal projects such as this one allow me to explore
      and test my understanding of certain areas.
