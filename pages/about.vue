      I am a fresh undergraduate from Tunku Abdul Rahman University of
      Management & Technology who is currently pursuing an internship at Finexus
      International Sdn Bhd. I have learned the fundamentals of Software
      Engineering throughout my tertiary studies. Topics covered during this
      time include Project Management, Quality Assurance, Development
      Principles, Methodologies, etc.
      <br />
      <br />
      I have dedicated my spare time to self-learning other disciplines within
      the Computing & IT field such as Web Development, Cybersecurity, DevOps
      and Data Science. Personal projects such as this one allow me to explore
      and test my understanding of certain areas. I plan to create more projects
      on my free time to learn upon previously mentioned topics that can be
      visited on GitHub or if they are web apps, a hosted URL.
      <br />
      <br />
      My final year project during undergraduate studies is on the topic of
      steganography and it's use in digital watermarking. I created an
      application to apply steganography algorithms such as Least Significant
      Bit and Discrete Cosine Transform to hide messages from the user onto the
      image. In addition, I implemented Firebase authentication and database
      management for user management features.
