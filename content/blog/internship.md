# Introduction

Embarking on an internship is a significant milestone for any student, offering the chance to transition from academic learning to real-world applications. As a final-year student in the Bachelor of Software Engineering (Honours) programme at Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management and Technology, I had the opportunity to intern at Finexus International Sdn. Bhd., a prominent player in the financial technology sector. This blog captures my journey, experiences, and the invaluable lessons I learned during my time at Finexus.

# What I expected from an internship experience

My expectations for an internship were rooted in gaining practical experience, honing my technical skills, and understanding the dynamics of a professional work environment. I anticipated that this experience would bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and its application in real-world scenarios. Additionally, I hoped to develop soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are crucial for professional growth.

# Applications & Interviews

The process of securing an internship involved meticulous preparation and several stages of evaluation. It began with submitting my application, which included my resume, academic transcripts, and a cover letter detailing my interest in the internship and my career aspirations. The interview process was designed to assess both technical competence and cultural fit. I underwent multiple rounds of interviews, including technical assessments and behavioral interviews, each aimed at evaluating different aspects of my capabilities and potential.

The Talent Acquisition Team at Finexus played a crucial role in facilitating the onboarding process, ensuring I had all the necessary tools and support from the outset.

# Experiences at a Real-world Environment

Working at Finexus provided a deep dive into the fintech industry, particularly through my involvement in the COREWORKS™ project, a comprehensive banking platform designed to enhance customer experiences. My role focused on the front-end development revamp using React.js, where I was responsible for redesigning user interfaces and integrating APIs. This project not only enhanced my technical skills in web development but also introduced me to tools such as DBeaver, Postman, and version control systems like Git and Subversion​.

   Clear communication and the ability to ask the right questions were vital in understanding tasks and expectations, which in turn improved my efficiency and output quality.

3. Team Collaboration<br>
   Working in a team exposed me to different perspectives and approaches, highlighting the value of collaboration and collective problem-solving.

4. Adaptability and Continuous Learning<br>
