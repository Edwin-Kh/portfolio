# Personal Portfolio

URL hosted by Netlify: https://edwinkh-portfolio.netlify.app

## Description

There are many benefits to using ready-made platforms to create a personal portfolio. However, I wanted to challenge myself as a learning developer to create a web app from my knowledge gained during my internship and studies. Hence, I am using an unfamiliar framework with a jump in complexity from my previous two projects done in Python & Jupyter Notebook. This is mainly a challenge to myself to learn front-end web development. I will be updating this project more often to accomodate my progress in my career.
